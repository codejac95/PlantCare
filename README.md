# PlantCare+

I use a variety of sensors to measure temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water levels and progress.
The system is powered by an Arduino, which monitors the environment and adjusts watering intervals based on real-time data.
The system includes a water tank that supplies water through connected hoses, allowing precise control over the amount
of water each plant receives. The sensors help ensure that the plants get the right amount of water at the right time,
preventing both overwatering and underwatering. I also use a ultra sonic sensor to measure the water levels to make sure
that the pump never runs without water in the tank. By automating the watering process, I can maintain an optimal environment
for my plants with minimal effort, even when I'm away.

I run this code in AruinoIDE
